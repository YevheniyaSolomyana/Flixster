## Flix Part 1

### User Stories

#### REQUIRED (10pts)
- [X] (10pts) User can view a list of movies (title, poster image, and overview) currently playing in theaters from the Movie Database API.

#### BONUS
üìù `NOTE:` Although the code runs successefully, the emulator failed to properly enable the landscape mode which is believed to be the issue due to the updated version Big Sur on Mac.
- [X] (2pts) Views should be responsive for both landscape/portrait mode.
   - [X] (1pt) In portrait mode, the poster image, title, and movie overview is shown.
   - [X] (1pt) In landscape mode, the rotated alternate layout should use the backdrop image instead and show the title and movie overview to the right of it.

- [ ] (2pts) Display a nice default [placeholder graphic](https://guides.codepath.org/android/Displaying-Images-with-the-Glide-Library#advanced-usage) for each image during loading
- [X] (2pts) Improved the user interface by experimenting with styling and coloring.
- [ ] (2pts) For popular movies (i.e. a movie voted for more than 5 stars), the full backdrop image is displayed. Otherwise, a poster image, the movie title, and overview is listed. Use Heterogenous RecyclerViews and use different ViewHolder layout files for popular movies and less popular ones.

### Notes
It would not let me add the AsyncHttpClient library unless I updated the minSdkVersion to 21 which resolved the issue.
Also, I could not get the landscape mode to work. I posted on Slack for help, but at the end it was decided that the issue was with Mac version Big Sur.
